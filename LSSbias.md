1. Use 2nd order perturbative bias expansion to forward model the 21cm field at the field level. The value of bias parameter is based on hydrodynamical simulation. 

2. RSD is simply a coordinate transformation. Therefore the 21cm brightness field can be decomposed into 1) a group of terms of biased parameter + operators and 2) a group of terms with Taylor expansion of RSD terms. However, this work doesn't include velocity bias and selection effect. 

3. Nice work with clear explanation of the physical meaning of bias parameters. However, the bias renormalization may be incorrect.
