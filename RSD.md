A perturbative treatment using GridSPT density and velocity field gives a poor prediction of redshift-space density field at the field-level. The result is highly sensitive to the UV behavior. The higher-order derivative introduce uncertainties on high-k end.
The paper motivates a non-perturbative coordinate transformation due to redshift space distortion.
